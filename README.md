Andie Romero's Portfolio

My first portfolio showcases color, spirituality, expression, and diversity. The page invites the viewer into a different reality and invites them to step into my mind. I hope to become a skillful design that could paint different realities in an interactive, vividly visual canvas. The Inspiration gallery displays album covers of some of my favorite producers and artists.

DISCLAIMER: I implemented the gallery elements in the inspiration page rather than the project page because I have not participated in any other design projects. I use other portfolios for examples.

Goals to add to my page:

create more interaction with links
play audio when user clicks in the Inspiration gallery with lightbox effect
expand the home page to make more interactive
